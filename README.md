## Project Abstract

The manual screening process for detecting Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in water samples is often laborious and time-consuming, posing significant challenges in timely response to potential health hazards. In this study, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to automate the detection of E. coli bacteria in microscopic images of water samples. Leveraging the power of deep learning, our model is trained on a diverse dataset of microscopic images containing both bacteria and non-bacterial image samples commonly found in water samples. The proposed model significantly reduces the screening time and offers the potential for real-time monitoring of water quality, thus enabling swift responses to microbial contamination events. Our findings suggest that the integration of CNN-based automation in water quality assessment holds promise for enhancing public health surveillance and ensuring the safety of water supplies.
